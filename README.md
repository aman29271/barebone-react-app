# barebone-react-app
A super-simple barebone React app 
Create-react-app is very powerful cli for setting up a react project. It also installs all the packages necessary for writing test. But sometimes you just want a simple barebone react app for get going.
And later if you need any package, you can install it right away.

Also I would like to point out that in create-react-app sometime after making even a slight code changes the cpu goes on fire. It's because create-react-app runs all the tests after that change also.

## Features
- Hot module reloading ( Thanks to webpack-dev-server by webpack )
- CSS and scss/sass file support
- Netlify deploy ( by default)
- Prettier ( code-formatter )
- Eslint ( linter)
- Production build optimized

## Installation
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/aman29271/barebone-react-app
 cd barebone-react-app
 yarn install # npm install
 ```
 Goto `http://localhost:3000` for preview.  

 You can change default port in `webpack.config.js`
